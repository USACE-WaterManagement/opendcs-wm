# Purpose

This repository exists to coordinate the running of OpenDCS and district custom algorithms within our cloud environments.
Everyone is welcome to use it if it meets their needs but the focus is on USACE WaterManagement functions.

If something appears to be very beneficial to the general usage of OpenDCS it should be merged into the main OpenDCS project
at https://github.com/opendcs/opendcs.
