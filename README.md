# Purpose

This repository exists to coordinate the running of OpenDCS and district custom algorithms within our cloud environments.
Everyone is welcome to use it if it meets their needs but the focus is on USACE WaterManagement functions.

If something appears to be very beneficial to the general usage of OpenDCS it should be merged into the main OpenDCS project
at https://github.com/opendcs/opendcs.


# Appstarter

This is a temporary program that will be used to handle multiple offices and compproc instances until such time
as the main OpenDCS can handle that correctly.

# District Algorithms (future)

There will be a location here to either:
1. Compile the provided code (prefered)
2. Reference an artifact somewhere, such as github packages from your own repo
3. Just include the jar(s) (frown upon and we'll likely just decompile it and go back to 1.)
